# NVidia- Graphics Cards in Fintech

**Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, Curtis Priem (Jensen Huang is still acting President & CEO), this company was intially a chip manufacturer.
In 1997 they released a graphics card called the RIVA 128 that started them on the path to making their first GPU. In 1999 the company relesead the "World's First GPU" the GeForce 256. 
Since then they have released a new line of cards every few years as processing power and manufacturing technology has risen, most recetly with the Nvidia GeForce 40-series. The RTX 4090, had 24GB of GDDR6X, 16384 Cuda cores, and can display 13k resolution.
This year NVidia estimates a revenue of $27 billion, and their stock price has been driven up several hundred percent because of it.**

## Graphics Cards in Fintech?

**The discovery that GPUs could harvest cryptocurrency faster than standard CPUs led the way to a shortage of GPUs in the late 2010's and into the 2020's. It is well known that people were hoarding, scalping, and chaining GPUs to mine Bitcoin and others.
NVidia took this a step further, unbeknownst to many, and did the same with powering AI models. One example was laid out in NVidia's blog article: "Fintech Company Blocks Fraud Attacks for Financial Institutions With AI and NVIDIA GPUs"**

"Featurespace got its start over a decade ago as a machine learning consultancy...it would take weeks for Featurespace to set up and train different deep learning models. 'With NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, the company has seen up to a 100x speedup in model training', director of analytical technology David Sutton said.'Compared to when we used CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs give us a really quick research-to-impact loop,' he added. 'It’s electrifying to work with something that can have an impact that quickly.'

In the time that they used to run just 10 trials, Featurespace’s researchers and data scientists can now run thousands of tests, which bolsters the statistical confidence of their results, enabling them to deploy only the best, tried-and-tested models.

Sutton said even a 1% increase in fraud detection discovered using the deep learning model could save large enterprises $20 million a year."

**And according to NVidia's financial sales team, fraud prevention and detection is just 1/4 of their impact. Their reach also extends to Trading, Banking, and Risk Managment. by putting powerful, raw computing behind every aspects of their enterprise customer's work they are attaining higher levels of accuracy and powering more and more technologies.** 

## Alternative Financing

**Nvidia is dipping its toes into the alternative financing domain with leasing out its physical products. For startups and small companies trying to compete in spaces with high barriers to entry, some initial costs can be hurdled with NVFS (Nvidia Financing Solutions). Leasing out extremely high-end at no upfront cost, more people have access to "Stay on the Cutting Edge" by having the most recent available infrastructure.** 

## Competition

**NVidia seems to be leading the way in their market space- evidenced blatantly by their current stock price- but companies like IBM, AMD, Intel, Apple, and others are workign to catch up. However, even competitive companies like Apple, Google, and most others leaning heavily into AI, are using NVDA components in many of their products. Most self driving concept cars have NVDA chips as they are making billions of calculations a second to map out the road while also planning out the movement forward. 
Looking ahead, it seems most competitors are working on making their own marks in the same spaces as NVidia, but only time will tell if they can overtake the clear industry leader.**

## Conclusion

**With the recent wild success of NVidia, it is hard to think of more that hey can do. As a consumer, I might like to see them get into manufacturing fully optimized computers and consoles, to avoid compatibility and porting issues we see now. THe next generation of gaming might come from procedurally generating the visuals in games, which saves on space but requires higher on-the-spot computing power. If they can crack the solution of creating better resolution and display using AI, creating and playing games and movies may become ubiquitously cheap and easy.**
